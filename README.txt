[!] Basic Description

Halcyon is a music player designed
with the following aspects in
mind:
  1. Simplicity for the user
  2. Absolute Optimizations
  3. Maximum User Control
  4. Easy API (if to be used as a
     library)
  5. A no cluster user interface

This is technically a third
iteration of an original project
titled MP4J. I ended the original
because of the sheer complexity
and noodle code that I wrote.

Currently the program supports:
  1. MP3
  2. WAV
Hopefully to support:
  1. OGG (Vorbis)
  2. AIFF
  3. FLAC
  4. MP4*
  5. AU
  6. AVI*

* - Video formats that will have
their audio track separated.

----------------------------------

[!] Extern.

The term extern here is to denote
"external"; or anything foreign.

The minimization of third party
libraries is a must so that users
can have as much of the original
code as possible without
secondary licenses.

The only main reason things like
a Discord RPC and the FlatLaf Laf
are bundled with the program is 
because they do not interfere
with audio playback. This is
unlike using someone else's audio
library for audio playback.

Currently there are a few 3rd 
party libraries that I will try
and minimize the usage of and
fully find alternatives and adopt
them.

----------------------------------

[!] Q&A

  1. Why Java?
    > This was more of a first 
    hand experience with Java, 
    before I started learning it
    in school (previous MP4J prj).
    > It also challenged me for
    stronger methods of 
    optimization methods, instead
    of using something like 
    Object Pascal, C#, C/C++, or
    JavaScript/TypeScript.
    
  2. Why not JavaFX?
    > In the section "Extern.", I 
    clearly state that I want to 
    minimize the usage of third
    party libraries for as much
    as possible.
    > JavaFX would not improve
    any form of making this 
    program faster. It only 
    simplifies the process of
    creating graphical items 
    using HTML/CSS.
