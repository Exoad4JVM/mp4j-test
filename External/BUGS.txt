[**] #44 "Inconsistent buffering strategy"
    Detailed Description: Besides a blocking reading strategy,
    a separate thread should be used to fetch data from
    the resource and then given to the local player. This ensures
    that no calls are blocking another when the audio is being
    played back.

[**] #31-CloudSpin "Cropping does not eliminate visual tearing during display"
    Detailed Description: Especially for artworks with higher resolutions, it is apparent, that
    the synchronized drawing takes a significant portion drawing in the intended
    chunk by chunk fashion (to reduce overhead). However, it is simply cropping by a scale factor
    and not to a defined size; this factor means that the sizing can be much greater for higher
    resolution. This downplays the fact that the artwork part has to be the most strictly optimized
    part of the program.
    ;   OK this applies to most modifiable assets such as the artwork display and the artwork backdrop
    components, which should all fall under this bug report.
    ;   General optimizations should also be made for the DeImage resizing and grayscaling algorithms
    ;   This implementation of a new graphics library is entitled CloudSpin
    Status: REVOKED; Working on this library as a stable for this project ONLY
    State: Experimental-Build ~ MP4J
    Difficulty: Decent; Requires a bunch of testing to get the right size to work for all form factors
        ; Also might require additional checking in between the individual artworks to make sure they are
        all in the range in which to crop and to perform additional resizing.
        ; Another problem that comes up with is that the larger the artwork is, the more overhead the
        program and the DeImage Manipulator will need to take in order to resize the image, especially if
        we have additional checks in place thus adding time.
        ; The aforementioned task could be simplified with a direct integer constant and pre-determination
        or a mask that can be applied onto the image to determine each time if the selected area is allowed.
        ; Another less optimized way is to cache the artwork and check fo the avaliability of that artwork
        per run, if that track has been run. However the downside of this is the ease for the user to mess with
        this and potentially result in messy work (although it is completely at the user's fault).
    Testing: None Yet.
